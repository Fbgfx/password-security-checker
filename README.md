📁 Project 2: Password Security Checker




🔐 Overview



The Password Security Checker evaluates user passwords against known breach data to help prevent credential reuse and account compromise. The project demonstrates an understanding of identity security, one of the most critical areas in modern security and governance.

🎯 Objectives
Detect compromised credentials


Educate users on password hygiene


Reduce credential-based attack risk


Apply real-world identity security concepts



🛠️ Technologies Used
Python


Have I Been Pwned API


SHA-1 Hashing


K-Anonymity


Streamlit



🔎 How It Works
Password is hashed locally (never sent in plain text)


Hash prefix is queried against breach database


Results indicate if the password has appeared in breaches


User receives actionable security guidance
